The Laws of Chess have two parts: 1. Basic Rules of Play and 2. Competitive Rules of Play. The English text is the authentic version of the Laws of Chess (which were adopted at the 93rd FIDE Congress at Chennai, India) coming into force on 1 January 2023. 0.2     Preface The Laws of Chess cannot cover all possible situations that may arise during a game, nor can they regulate all administrative questions. Where cases are not precisely regulated by an Article of the Laws, it should be possible to reach a correct decision by studying analogous situations which are regulated in the Laws. The Laws assume that arbiters have the necessary competence, sound judgement and absolute objectivity. Too detailed a rule might deprive the arbiter of his/her freedom of judgement and thus prevent him/her from finding a solution to a problem dictated by fairness, logic and special factors. FIDE appeals to all chess players and federations to accept this view. A necessary condition for a game to be rated by FIDE is that it shall be played according to the FIDE Laws of Chess. It is recommended that competitive games not rated by FIDE be played according to the FIDE Laws of Chess. Member federations may ask FIDE to give a ruling on matters relating to the Laws of Chess. This Preface to the Laws of Chess is very important.The Laws cannot cover everypossible situation which may arise during a game.Where the Laws are specific on asituationanarbitershouldensurethattheyarefollowed.However,thereareoccasions when an arbiter must make a decision on a situation which is not covered,or not covered completely, by the Laws.When making such decisions the arbitershould consider similar situations which are covered.In all cases the decision shouldbe based on common sense, logic, fairness and any special circumstances.Decisionscanbemadeinconsultationwithotherarbiters. As it is always necessary for an arbiter to make decisions and to solve problemsduring a game, experience is important.More important, however, is an excellentknowledge ofthecurrentLawsandtotalobjectivityatalltimes.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  BASIC RULES OF PLAY   Article 1: The Nature and Objectives of the Game of Chess 1.1     The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. 1.2     The player with the light-coloured pieces (White) makes the first move, then the players move alternately, with the player with the dark-coloured pieces (Black) making the next move. 1.3     A player is said to ‘have the move’ when his/her opponent’s move has been ‘made’. 1.4     The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. 1.4.1    The player who achieves this goal is said to have ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king is not allowed.  1.4.2    The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game. 1.5     If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate the opponent’s king, the game is drawn (see Article 5.2.2).  Article 2: The Initial Position of the Pieces on the Chessboard Ifneitherplayercan win thenthegameisautomaticallydecidedasa draw.Thearbitershouldtherefore stepintodeclare this when: (a) neitherplayer hasmatingpotential, or (b) thepositionissuchthatneitherplayercan getcheckmate(knownasa‘deadposition’). Thesimplestexample of(a)isKvK. Thefollowing,wherewhitehasjustplayedh5,isanexampleofadeadposition. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle 2.1     The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares). The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square to the right of the player is white. 2.2     At the beginning of the game White has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces); Black has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces). These pieces are as follows:       A white king usually indicated by the symbol  K A white queen usually indicated by the symbol  Q Two white rooks usually indicated by the symbol  R Two white bishops usually indicated by the symbol  B Two white knights usually indicated by the symbol  N Eight white pawns usually indicated by the symbol    A black king usually indicated by the symbol  K A black queen usually indicated by the symbol  Q Two black rooks usually indicated by the symbol  R Two black bishops usually indicated by the symbol  B Two black knights usually indicated by the symbol  N Eight black pawns usually indicated by the symbol    Staunton Pieces  p  Q  K  B  N  R 2.3     The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as follows:  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    Article 2.4     The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The eight horizontal rows of squares are called ‘ranks’. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’.    Article 3: The Moves of the Pieces 3.1     It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. 3.1.1    If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. 3.1.2    A piece is said to attack an opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to Articles 3.2 to 3.8. 3.1.3    A piece is considered to attack a square even if this piece is constrained from moving to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under attack.   3.2     The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands. Chessboardscanbemadeofdifferentmaterials.Thesquaresshouldbeincontrasting dark (black or brown) and light (white or cream) squares.It is useful thatit is not shiny to avoid reflections and disturbance of players. The dimension of thechessboard must fit with the dimension of the pieces. (For more information see FIDEHandbookC.02StandardofChessequipmentandTournamentVenueforFIDETournaments). It is very important to check the orientation of the chessboard and the correct positionof all the pieces before starting the game. By doing this, an arbiter can avoid a lot ofpossible claims about the position of Kings and Queens or Knights and Bishops beingreversed. Sometimes, there is a disagreement between the players about the direction that theknights face. Each player has his own habits regarding this. The opponent shouldrespect this and each player may place his own knights as he likes before the start ofthe game. A player can adjust pieces during a game only when it is his move, and onlyafter he has informed his opponent that he is going to adjust them (See Article 4:“J’adoube”–“Iadjust”). Beingpinnedagainstitsownkingdoesnotstopapiecefromattackingthesquaresitcould otherwise move to.  Evenapinnedpiececan‘check’the opponent’sking. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t     Article 3.3     The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.  3.4     The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a diagonal on which it stands.  3.5     When making these moves, the bishop, rook or queen may not move over any intervening pieces. Initially, each player has two bishops, one of which moves on light squares, the otherone on dark squares. If a player has two (or more) bishops on squares of the samecolour, it must be that the second bishop is the result of a promotion (See article3.7.5.1),or anillegalmovewas played. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  Article 3.6     The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.  3.7     The pawn: 3.7.1    The pawn may move forward to the square immediately in front of it on the same file, provided that this square is unoccupied, or 3.7.2    on its first move the pawn may move as in 3.7.1 or alternatively it may advance two squares along the same file, provided that both squares are unoccupied, or 3.7.3    the pawn may move to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece. 3.7.3.1    A pawn occupying a square on the same rank as and on an adjacent file to an opponent’s pawn which has just advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as though the latter had been moved only one square. 3.7.3.2    This capture is only legal on the move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.  3.7.3.3    When a player, having the move, plays a pawn to the rank furthest from its starting position, he/she must exchange that pawn as part of the same move for a new queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same colour on the intended square of arrival. This is called the square of ‘promotion’. 3.7.3.4    The player\\'s choice is not restricted to pieces that have been captured previously. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle 3.7.3.5    This exchange of a pawn for another piece is called promotion, and the effect of the new piece is immediate.      3.8     There are two different ways of moving the king: 3.8.1    by moving to an adjoining square         3.8.2    by ‘castling’. This is a move of the king and either rook of the same colour along the player’s first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has just crossed.   Before white kingside castling Before black queenside castling After white kingside castling After black queenside castling     In case of a promotionwhen the player cannot find the required piece, he has theright to stop the game immediately and ask the Arbiter to bring him the piece hewants. The arbiter should provide the requested piece and restart the clock. Theplayer then continues to consider his move. Heis not obliged to promote to therequested piece. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    Before white queenside castling Before black kingside castling After white queenside castling After black kingside castling 3.8.2.1    The right to castle has been lost: 1) If the king has already moved, or 2) With a rook that has already moved. 3.8.2.2    Castling is prevented temporarily: 3) If the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one or more of the opponent\\'s pieces, or 4) If there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected. 3.9     The king in check: 3.9.1    The king is said to be \\'in check\\' if it is attacked by one or more of the opponent\\'s pieces, even if such pieces are constrained from moving to the square occupied by the king because they would then leave or place their own king in check. 3.9.2    No piece can be moved that will either expose the king of the same colour to check or leave that king in check. 3.10   Legal and illegal moves; illegal positions: 3.10.1     A move is legal when all the relevant requirements of Articles 3.1 – 3.9 have been fulfilled. 3.10.2    A move is illegal when it fails to meet the relevant requirements of Articles 3.1 – 3.9. 3.10.3    A position is illegal when it cannot have been reached by any series of legal moves.   In case of a promotionwhen the player cannot find the required piece, he has theright to stop the game immediately and ask the Arbiter to bring him the piece hewants. The arbiter should provide the requested piece and restart the clock. Theplayer then continues to consider his move. Heis not obliged to promote to therequested piece. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    Article 4: The Act of Moving the Pieces 4.1     Each move must be played with one hand only. 4.2     Adjusting the pieces or other physical contact with a piece: 4.2.1    Only the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares, provided that he/she first expresses his/her intention (for example by saying “j’adoube” or “I adjust”).          4.2.2    Any other physical contact with a piece, except for clearly accidental contact, shall be considered to be intent. Article 4.2.1 may only be used to correct displaced pieces. If the opponent is notpresent then an arbiter, if present, should be informed before any adjustment takesplace. The player should always announce his intention to adjust a piece.If he doesnotdothisthenthe normaltouchmoverulesapply(see4.3). Accordingto thisrule,ifaplayerhasnot said“Iadjust”orsomething similarbeforetouching a piece and touching the piece is not accidental, the touched piece must bemoved. For example, if White played 1 Be2xg5 by lifting the bishop and thenremoving the Knight,the Bishop on e2 must be moved as it was touched intending tomove. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle   4.3     Except as provided in Article 4.2.1, if the player having the move touches on the chessboard, with the intention of moving or capturing: 4.3.1    one or more of his/her own pieces, he/she must move the first piece touched that can be moved. 4.3.2    one or more of his/her opponent’s pieces, he/she must capture the first piece touched that can be captured. 4.3.3    one or more pieces of each colour, he/she must capture the first touched opponent’s piece with his/her first touched piece or, if this is illegal, move or capture the first piece touched that can be moved or captured. If it is unclear whether the player’s own piece or his/her opponent’s piece was touched first, the player’s own piece shall be considered to have been touched before his/her opponent’s. 4.4     If a player having the move: 4.4.1    touches his/her king and a rook he/she must castle on that side if it is legal to do so 4.4.2    deliberately touches a rook and then his/her king he/she is not allowed to castle on that side on that move and the situation shall be governed by Article 4.3.1.  4.4.3    intending to castle, touches the king and then a rook, but castling with this rook is illegal, the player must make another legal move with his/her king (which may include castling with the other rook). If the king has no legal move, the player is free to make any legal move.   4.4.4    promotes a pawn, the choice of the piece is finalised when the piece has touched the square of promotion. In thiscase theplayermustmove hisrook,ifpossible.Ifnorookmove ispossible,heshouldmovehis king.(Article4.3.1) Please note that castling is a king move. If a player tries to castle and it is found to beillegal,thentheplayermustmakeakingmovethatislegal.Ifthereisnolegalmoveof the king the player is free to make any move – he is not obliged to move the rook(butsee4.4.2). When a player places an inverted (upside – down) Rook on the promotion square andcontinues the game, the piece is considered as a Rook, even if he names it as a“Queen” or any other piece. If he moves the upside-down rook diagonally, it becomesan illegal move. On his own move the opponent may turn the rook the right way up.However,toavoidconflict,itisadvisable that anarbiterisrequested todothis. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle   4.5     If none of the pieces touched in accordance with Article 4.3 or Article 4.4 can be moved or captured, the player may make any legal move. 4.6     The act of promotion may be performed in various ways: 4.6.1    the pawn does not have to be placed on the square of arrival. 4.6.2    removing the pawn and putting the new piece on the square of promotion may occur in any order. 4.6.3    If an opponent’s piece stands on the square of promotion, it must be captured. 4.7     When, as a legal move or part of a legal move, a piece has been released on a square, it cannot be moved to another square on this move. The move is considered to have been made in the case of: 4.7.1    A capture, when the captured piece has been removed from the chessboard and the player, having placed his/her own piece on its new square, has released this capturing piece from his/her hand. 4.7.2    Castling, when the player\\'s hand has released the rook on the square previously crossed by the king. When the player has released the king from his/her hand, the move is not yet made, but the player no longer has the right to make any move other than castling on that side, if this is legal. If castling on this side is illegal, the player must make another legal move with his/her king (which may include castling with the other rook). If the king has no legal move, the player is free to make any legal move. 4.7.3    Promotion, when the player\\'s hand has released the new piece on the square of promotion and the pawn has been removed from the board. 4.8     A player forfeits his/her right to claim against his/her opponent’s violation of Articles 4.1 – 4.7 once the player touches a piece with the intention of moving or capturing it. 4.9     If a player is unable to move the pieces, an assistant, who shall be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to perform this operation.   When a player places an inverted (upside – down) Rook on the promotion square andcontinues the game, the piece is considered as a Rook, even if he names it as a“Queen” or any other piece. If he moves the upside-down rook diagonally, it becomesan illegal move. On his own move the opponent may turn the rook the right way up.However,toavoidconflict,itisadvisable that anarbiterisrequested todothis. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  Article 5: The Completion of the Game 5.1.1    The game is won by the player who has checkmated his/her opponent’s king. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 – 4.7. 5.1.2    The game is lost by the player who declares he/she resigns (this immediately ends the game), unless the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves. In this case the result of the game is a draw.  5.2.1    The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his/her king is not in check. The game is said to end in ‘stalemate’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the stalemate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 – 4.7. 5.2.2    The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 – 4.7. 5.2.3    The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game. Aplayermayresign in anumberof differentways: - stopping theclock - announcinghisresignation - knocking overhisking - reachingouthishandtotheopponent - signingthescoresheets,andsoon.  All of these possibilities are capable of being misinterpreted. Therefore, the situationhastobeclarified. At the end of a game the arbiter should ensure that both scoresheets show the sameresult. A player who does not wish to continue a game and leaves without resigning – ornotifying the arbiter – is being discourteous. He may be penalized, at the discretion ofthe ChiefArbiter,for poor sportsmanship. This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specifiednumberofmoves by eachplayer)isnotineffect. The best way to conclude a game is towrite down the result on the score sheet (ifthere is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it. This then forms a legaldocument,buteventhen,things cangowrong. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  COMPETITIVE RULES OF PLAY  Article 6: The Chessclock 6.1     ‘Chessclock’ means a clock with two time displays, connected to each other in such a way that only one of them can run at a time. ‘Clock’ in the Laws of Chess means one of the two time displays. Each time display has a ‘flag’. ‘Flag-fall’ means the expiration of the allotted time for a player.  6.2     Handling the chessclock: 6.2.1    During the game each player, having made his/her move on the chessboard, shall pause his/her own clock and start his/her opponent’s clock (that is to say, he/she shall press his/her clock). This ‘completes’ the move. A move is also completed if: 6.2.1.1     the move ends the game (see Articles 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 9.2.1, 9.6.1 and 9.6.2), or 6.2.1.2     the player has made his/her next move, when his/her previous move was not completed.   6.2.2    A player must be allowed to pause his/her clock after making his/her move, even after the opponent has made his/her next move. The time between making the move on the chessboard and pressing the clock is regarded as part of the time allotted to the player. Somedigitalclocksshow“–“insteadofaflag.

It is forbidden for a player to keep his/her finger on the clock or to ‘hover’ over it.     6.2.4    The players must handle the chessclock properly. It is forbidden to press it forcibly, to pick it up, to press the clock before moving or to knock it over. Improper clock handling shall be penalised in accordance with Article 12.9.  6.2.5    Only the player whose clock is running is allowed to adjust the pieces. 6.2.6    If a player is unable to use the clock, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to perform this operation. His/Her clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way. This adjustment of the clock shall not apply to the clock of a player with a disability. 6.2.4,itisconsidered asan illegal moveanditispenalized according to article7.5.3.

All these must be specified in advance.  6.3.2    The time saved by a player during one period is added to his/her time available for the next period, where applicable. In the time-delay mode both players receive an allotted ‘main thinking time’. Each player also receives a ‘fixed extra time’ with every move. The countdown of the main thinking time only commences after the fixed extra time has expired. Provided the player presses his/her clock before the expiration of the fixed extra time, the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed extra time used.  6.4 Immediately after a flag falls, the requirements of Article 6.3.1 must be checked. A game may have more than one period. The requirements of the subsequent totalnumber of moves and the additional amount of time with each move for each periodmustbespecifiedinadvance.Theseparametersshouldnotchangeduringatournament.Aplay-offmayhavedifferenttime controls. In the Laws of Chess Increment and Delay are treated in the same way.For example,when calculating the length ofthe playing session both are multiplied by 60 to findthe totaltime. INCREMENT – a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) timewith each move played.The first increment is added at the start of the game.Oftencalled Fischer Bonus and shown on some clocks as FISCH.If a player moves quicklytheirtime canincrease. There are two types of delay, Bronstein and Simple (or US).With delay a player cannever increase their time beyond the amount they had at the start of a move.If theclock is pressed before all of the bonus time has been used, the remaining bonus timeislost.Bothdelay methods havethesameoveralleffect. US DELAY:The clock shows the main time in the main display.Another display willshow the countdown of the bonus time.Only when the bonus time has been exhaustedwillthemaintimestarttodecrease. BRONSTEIN DELAY: With this mode the bonus is added to the main time and theclockstarts countdownimmediately. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle   6.5 Before the start of the game the arbiter shall decide where the chessclock is placed.   6.6 At the time determined for the start of the game White’s clock is started. This means that the arbiter and/or the players have to check if the minimum numbersofmoves havebeencompleted. Consider a game of 90 minutes for 30 moves and 30 minutes for the rest of the game.It is normalto investigatewhether 30 moves have beencompletedby bothplayersonlyafteraflaghasfallen. If a move (push) counter is used in a digital clock, then it is possible to establishwhether 30 moves have been made before a flag fall, as a “-“ indication appears onthe clockiftheplayerdoesnotcomplete the 30movesbefore theallottedtime. Where electronic clocks are used and both clocks show 0.00, the Arbiter can usuallyestablish which flag fell first, with the help of the “-“ or any other flag indication.Where mechanical clocks are used then article III.3.1 of the Guidelines about gameswithoutincrementincludingQuickplayFinishes isapplied. In individual tournaments the chess-clock is normally placed on theright oftheplayerwhohastheblackpieces.Thechessboardsshallbeplacedsothatthearbiterisabletocheck as many clocks aspossibleatthesametime. Where either player, through disability, would have difficulty with the position of theclock and would prefer the clock on his other side this should be accommodated byrotatingtheboardratherthanmovingtheclock. In team competitions the members of the same team usually sit in a row. Then thepiecesaresetalternateblackandwhite and theclocksall point thesameway. Be careful! It happens quite often in team competitions that a player presses the clockofhisneighbour. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle   6.7     Default time: 6.7.1    The regulations of an event shall specify a default time in advance. If the default time is not specified, then it is zero. Any player who arrives at the chessboard after the default time shall lose the game unless the arbiter decides otherwise. 6.7.2    If the regulations of an event specify that the default time is not zero and if neither player is present initially, White shall lose all the time that elapses until he/she arrives, unless the regulations of an event specify or the arbiter decides otherwise.     6.8 A flag is considered to have fallen when the arbiter observes the fact or when Ifthedefaulttimeisnot0,itisadvisablethatthearbiterpubliclyannouncesthetimeofthe startoftheroundandthathewritesdownthe startingtime.

In matches and smaller tournaments, where there are enough arbiters to do so, theclocksmay bestartedbythe arbiters. In general, in tournaments with many players the arbiter announces the start of theround and states that White’s clock is started. The arbiter then goes round the roomcheckingthatWhite’sclock hasbeenstartedonallboards. Where the push counter is used to add time after the first time control (often 30moves),itisdesirableforarbiterstostartallWhite’sclocks. In large tournaments where the push counter is used, the Chief Arbiter should decidewhether the length of time needed to start all of the clocks justifies this being done bythe arbiters rather than by the player. If the players start the clock, when the arbitersgo around checking that the clocks have been started, they must also make sure thatthe clock correctly indicateswhich player iswhite. The start of the session is the moment, when the arbiter announces it. If the defaulttime is 0, the arbiter shall declare the game lost for the players who are not present attheir boards. It is preferable to display a large digital countdown in the playing hall.For FIDE events with fewer than 30 players an announcement must be made fiveminutes before the round is due to start and again one minute before the start of thegame. Alternatively, a clock should be on the wall inside the playing hall and provide theofficialtime ofthetournament. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  either player has made a valid claim to that effect. Article  6.9 Except where one of Articles 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3 applies, if a player does not complete the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time, the game is lost by that player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.  This means that a simple flag fall might not lead the Arbiter to declare the game lostfor the player whose flag has fallen. The Arbiter has to check the final position on thechessboard and only if the opponent can checkmate the player’s king by any possibleseries of legal moves, can he declare the game won by the opponent. Where there areforced moves that lead to a checkmate or to a stalemate by the player, then the resultofthegame is declaredasadraw. Thetable  below  shows  a  few  situations  with  the  corresponding  results:  6.10   Chessclock setting: 6.10.1    Every indication given by the chessclock is considered to be conclusive in the absence of any evident defect. A chessclock with an evident defect shall be replaced by the arbiter, who shall use his/her best judgement when determining the times to be shown on the replacement chessclock.  Aflagisconsideredtohavefallenwhenitisnoticedorclaimed,notwhenitphysically happened.If a result is reached between a flag fall and the fall beingnoticed,the result is not changed.   The arbiter should announce flag fall as soon ashenotices it. Alsointhecaseofarticles9.6.1and9.6.2,evenifaplayerdoesnotcompletetheprescribed numberofmovesintheallottedtime,the gameis drawn. It is desirable to check the clocks during the round, for instance every 30 minutes, andto record the times and the number of moves made, by using a time-control sheet (seeattheendoftheManual).

The arbiter shall install the correct setting and adjust the times and move-counter, if necessary. He/She shall use his/her best judgement when determining the clock settings.  Article 6.11.1    If the game needs to be interrupted, the arbiter shall pause the chessclock.  Article  6.11.2    A player may pause the chessclock only in order to seek the arbiter’s assistance, for example when promotion has taken place and the piece required is not available. 6.11.3    The arbiter shall decide when the game restarts. 6.11.4    If a player pauses the chessclock in order to seek the arbiter’s assistance, the arbiter shall determine whether the player had any valid reason for doing so. If the player has no valid reason for pausing the chessclock, the player shall be penalised in accordance with Article 12.9.  6.12.1    Screens, monitors, or demonstration boards showing the current position on the chessboard, the moves and the number of moves made/completed, and clocks which also show the number of moves, are allowed in the playing hall. 6.12.2    The player may not make a claim relying only on information shown in this manner.

This includes the right not to change the clock times. He/She shall also, if necessary, adjust the clock’s move-counter. Article 7.2.1    If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, the game shall be cancelled and a new game shall be played.  7.2.2    If during a game it is found that the chessboard has been placed contrary to Article 2.1, the game shall continue but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly placed chessboard. 7.3     If a game has started with colours reversed then, if less than 10 moves have been made by both players, it shall be discontinued and a new game played with the correct colours. After 10 moves or more, the game shall continue.   Article  7.4     Dispaced pieces: An arbiter or player must realise that the information displayed may be incorrect. Ifthe number of moves already played has been established by the arbiter before hebegins to count the clock counter may be used to confirm that 50/75 moves have beenplayed. The error must be discovered before the end of the game otherwise the result willstand.If an electronic board shows this error or stops recording the moves, theoperator should inform the arbiter. It is the arbiter’s duty to check if such a situationhasbeencausedbyanirregularityinplay. After Black has made move 10 the game shall continue, otherwise, a new game shallbe played with the correct colours. It doesn’t matter what the current position on thechessboardis andhowmany piecesor pawnshavebeencaptured. If a game with reversed colours has ended by normal means (for example checkmate,resignation or draw by agreement), in less than ten (10) moves by both players, thenthe resultstands. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle  7.4.1    If a player displaces one or more pieces, he/she shall re-establish the correct position in his/her own time. 7.4.2    If necessary, either the player or his/her opponent shall pause the chessclock and ask for the arbiter’s assistance. 7.4.3    The arbiter may penalise the player who displaces the pieces.   7.5     Illegal moves: 7.5.1    An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his/her clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. Articles 4.3 and 4.7 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position. 7.5.2    If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn. 7.5.3    If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be Player A’s clock is running when Player B accidentally displaces a piece.Player Ashould not restart Player B’s clock but shouldpause the clock and summon thearbiter. The arbiter may then either add time to A’s clock or subtract time from B’sclock. If A restarts B’s clock this creates several problems with increments beingwrongly addedandthepushcounteraffected. Most problems happen in Rapid Chess or Blitz. The penalty should be according toArticle12.9.Aplayershouldnotbeforfeitedimmediatelyforaccidentallydisplacinga piece. If he did it deliberately, perhaps in order to gain time, or does itseveraltimes,thatis different. It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game.

However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.   7.6     If, during a game it is found that any piece has been displaced from its correct square, the position before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity.

He/She must record his/her previous move before making another. 8.1.4    The scoresheet shall be used only for recording the moves, the times of the clocks, offers of a draw, matters relating to a claim and other relevant data. 8.1.5    Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet with a symbol (=). 8.1.6    If a player is unable to keep score, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to record the moves. His/Her clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way. This adjustment of the clock shall not apply to a player with a disability. 8.2     The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter throughout the game.

The scoresheet does not have to be visible to the opponent (except when the opponentneeds it tobring his own scoresheet up to date e.g. to satisfy 8.5.2) but the arbitermust be able to see it and, most importantly, how many moves have been recorded. Itisacceptableforaplayertohaveapenonhisscoresheetbutitshouldnotobscurethe lastmovefromthearbiter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle   8.3     The scoresheets are the property of the organiser of the competition. An electronic scoresheet with an evident defect shall be replaced by the arbiter.  8.4     If a player has less than five minutes left on his/her clock during an allotted period of time and does not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with each move, then for the remainder of the period he/she is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1.1. 8.5     Incomplete scoresheets: 8.5.1    If neither player keeps score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after a flag has fallen the arbiter shall pause the chessclock. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the arbiter’s or the opponent’s scoresheet.  8.5.2    If only one player has not kept score under Article 8.4, he/she must, as soon as either flag has fallen, update his/her scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard. Provided it is that player’s move, he/she may use his/her opponent’s scoresheet, but must return it before making a move. 8.5.3    If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must reconstruct the game on a second chessboard under the control of the arbiter or an assistant. He/She shall first record the actual game position, clock times, whose clock was running and the number of moves made/completed, if Aplayerisnotallowedtokeeptheoriginalscoresheet,unlessthetournamentregulationsspecifyotherwise.ItbelongstotheOrganisers.Theplayerhastodeliverit tothearbiterwhenthegameisfinishedandshould keepacopy (ifany). It happens quite often that in this time trouble phase the player asks the arbiter howmany moves are leftuntil thetime control. The arbiter mustnotanswer this as itwould be giving advice.Even if the required number of moves have been made thearbiter should not intervene until after a flag fall. At this point the arbiter should stopthe chess-clock and request both players to update their scoresheets.When they arecompleted the arbiter will restart the clock of the player on the move.If a playerdelays updating his scoresheet, sometimes contemplating his next move, he should bewarned. Notice that, in this situation, after a flag fall, the arbiter does not stop the clocks.Ifthe opponent refuses to make his scoresheet available the arbiter can insist that hedoesso. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  this information is available, before reconstruction takes place. Article  8.6     If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made shall be considered as the first of the following time period, unless there is evidence that more moves have been made or completed. 8.7     At the conclusion of the game both players shall indicate the result of the game by signing both scoresheets or approve the result on their electronic scoresheets. Even if incorrect, this result shall stand, unless the arbiter decides otherwise.    Article 9: The Drawn Game 9.1     Draw offers and event Regulations: 9.1.1    The regulations of an event may specify that players cannot offer or agree to a draw, whether in less than a specified number of moves or at all, without the consent of the arbiter.  9.1.2    However, if the regulations of an event allow a draw agreement the following shall apply: It is very important for the Arbiter to record the correct result of the games. At themoment the Arbiter sees that a game has been finished,he should go to that boardandcheckiftheplayershaverecordedtheresultofthegameandsignedbothscoresheets. The arbiter should immediately check that both score sheets show thesameresult. Ifa competition applies this rule, then the required number ofmovesor the noagreement at all condition, should be communicated to the players in the invitation tothe tournament. It is advisable for the Arbiter to repeat the rule before the start of thetournament.Itisclearthattheruleappliesonlyfordrawagreements.Articles9.2, 9.3 and 9.6 still apply during the whole game and give the possibility to the players todraw in less than the specified number of moves, which must be accepted by theArbiter. For example, if two players make a draw by three-fold occurrence after 20moves, in a tournament where there is a draw restriction rule before 30 moves havebeen completed by both players, then the Arbiter must allow the draw. If neitherplayer claims a draw by three-fold occurrence, and an Arbiter is aware that the sameposition (per 9.2.2) has occurred at least 5 times, then he must intervene, see Article9.6.1. Thereconstructionshouldtakeplaceafterbothclockshavebeenstoppedandshouldbe done awayfrom theothergames,soasnottodisturbthem. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle  9.1.2.1    A player wishing to offer a draw shall do so after having made a move on the chessboard and before pressing his/her clock. An offer at any other time during play is still valid but Article 11.5 must be considered. No conditions can be attached to the offer. In both cases the offer cannot be withdrawn and remains valid until the opponent accepts it, rejects it orally, rejects it by touching a piece with the intention of moving or capturing it, or the game is concluded in some other way. 9.1.2.2    The offer of a draw shall be recorded by each player on his/her scoresheet with the symbol (=). 9.1.2.3    A claim of a draw under Article 9.2 or 9.3 shall be considered to be an offer of a draw.    9.2     The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by a player having the move, when the same position for at least the third time (not necessarily by a repetition of moves): 9.2.1    is about to appear, if he/she first indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the This is a valuable rule for the arbiter and its use should be encouraged.

Thus positions are not the same if: Article 9.2.3.1    at the start of the sequence a pawn could have been captured en passant. 9.2.3.2    a king had castling rights with a rook that has not been moved, but forfeited these after moving. The castling rights are lost only after the king or rook is moved.    9.3     The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by a player having the move, if: 9.3.1    he/she indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the electronic scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his/her intention to make this move which will result in the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or 9.3.2    the last 50 moves by each player have been completed without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.  9.4     If the player touches a piece as in Article 4.3, he/she loses the right to claim a draw under Article 9.2 or 9.3 on that move. Only the player whose move it is, and whose clock is running, is allowed to claim adraw in this way. If the procedure of a draw claim is correct, but the player forgets ordoesn’t know that he shall write his intended move, it is advisable that instead ofrejecting the claim, the arbiter says “Make your claim legal”, if the player asks howhe can make his claim legal, the arbiter can, according to article 11.2, explainsconditionsofacorrectclaim.

If the claim was based on an intended move, this move must be made in accordance with Articles 3 and 4.  9.6     If one or both of the following occur(s) then the game is drawn: 9.6.1    the same position has appeared, as in 9.2.2 at least five times. 9.6.2    any series of at least 75 moves have been made by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.

But in 11.2.4 it is possible to include, in the regulations, prohibition of theopponent leavingthe playingareawithoutthepermissionofthearbiter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle 11.3   Notes and electronic devices: 11.3.1    During play the players are forbidden to use any notes, sources of information or advice, or analyse any game on another chessboard. 11.3.2    During a game, a player is forbidden to have any electronic device not specifically approved by the arbiter in the playing venue. 11.3.2.1    However, the regulations of an event may allow such devices to be stored in a player’s bag, provided the device is completely switched off. This bag must be placed as agreed with the arbiter. Both players are forbidden to use this bag without permission of the arbiter. 11.3.2.2    If it is evident that a player has such a device on their person in the playing venue, the player shall lose the game. The opponent shall win. The regulations of an event may specify a different, less severe, penalty. 11.3.3     The arbiter may require the player to allow his/her clothes, bags, other items or body to be inspected, in private. The arbiter or person authorised by the arbiter shall inspect the player, and shall be of the same gender as the player. If a player refuses to cooperate with these obligations, the arbiter shall take measures in accordance with Article 12.9. The regulations about electronic devices are now very strict. No mobile phone isallowed in the playing venue and it makes no difference if it is switched on or off.If amobile phone (even switched off) is found with a player, his game is immediately lostand the opponent shall win. The result shall be 1-0 or 0-1. It doesn’t matter if, whenthe mobile phone is found, the opponent cannotcheckmate theoffending player byanyseriesoflegalmoves:hewinsthegame.Theopponentmayhavecheatedearlier.  It is different if the game has not yet started. Suppose the following situation occurs:There isnozero‐tolerance. Player A isin the playing hall at thestart ofthe round.His opponent, Player B is absent. Immediately after player A made his first move hismobile rings. The arbiter declares the game lost for Player A. Some minutes later, butstill on time, Player B arrives. The score is “‐/+”, it is not a “played” game and itcannot be rated.However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance(in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article(perhaps a fine).They can also include in the regulations ofthe event the possibilityof bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions arefulfilled: that it is completely switched offand stored in a separate bag, so that it isnot in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag duringthe game, without the arbiter\\'s permission (and he cannot take the bag with him to thetoilet,andsoon.). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle  11.3.4     Smoking, including e-cigarettes, is permitted only in the section of the venue designated by the arbiter.   11.4   Players who have finished their games shall be considered to be spectators.  11.5   It is forbidden to distract or annoy the opponent in any manner whatsoever. This includes unreasonable claims, unreasonable offers of a draw or the introduction of a source of noise into the playing area.  11.6   Infraction of any part of Articles 11.1 – 11.5 shall lead to penalties in accordance with Article 12.9. 11.7   Persistent refusal by a player to comply with the Laws of Chess shall be penalised by loss of the game. The arbiter shall decide the score of the opponent.  11.8   If both players are found guilty according to Article 11.7, the game shall be declared lost by both players. 11.9   A player shall have the right to request from the arbiter an explanation of particular points in the Laws of Chess. Aplayerwho arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity tostore his device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed inabag,ifthisisallowed. Ifpossible,thissmokingareashouldbeclosetotheplayingareaandsupervisedbyanArbiter or anAssistant. It means that the players, who finished their games, may have to leave the playingarea. Nevertheless, give them a few minutes to watch the other boards, making suretheydonotdisturbplayers stillinplay. Even if the draw offers or claims are quite reasonable, repeating them too often canannoytheopponent.TheArbitermustalwaysintervenewhentheopponentisdisturbedor distracted. It is very difficult to give a general guideline for the application of this Article, but ifan arbiter has to warn the player for the third or fourth time, this is a good reason todeclare the game lost. It is necessary to inform the player that Article 11.7 shall beappliedatthenextinfringement. For example, players often ask ifthey can castle or capture ‘en passant’ in theposition on their board.An arbiter must not answer ‘yes’or ‘no’but must informthem ofthe meaning ofthe appropriate Law.It is also commonfor a player to askhowtoclaimadraw(seecommentunder article9.2.2.2). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tArticle 11.10 Unless the regulations of an event specify otherwise, a player may appeal against any decision of the arbiter, even if the player has signed the scoresheet (see Article 8.7).  11.11 Both players must assist the arbiter in any situation requiring reconstruction of the game, including draw claims. 11.12     Checking a ‘three times occurrence of the position’ or a ’50 moves’ claim is a duty of the players, under supervision of the arbiter.   Article 12: The Role of the Arbiter (see Preface) 12.1   The arbiter shall see that the Laws of Chess are observed. 12.2   The arbiter shall: 12.2.1    ensure fair play, 12.2.2    act in the best interest of the competition, 12.2.3    ensure that a good playing environment is maintained, 12.2.4    ensure that the players are not disturbed, 12.2.5    supervise the progress of the competition, 12.2.6    take special measures in the interests of disabled players and those who need medical attention, 12.2.7    follow the Fair-Play Rules or Guidelines It is necessary to advise the player of his right to appeal, if he does not agree with theArbiter’s decision.

He/She shall not indicate the number of moves completed, except in applying Article 8.5 when at least one flag has fallen. The arbiter shall refrain from informing a player that his/her opponent has completed a move or that the player has not pressed his/her clock. 12.7   If someone observes an irregularity, he/she may inform only the arbiter. Players in other games must not to speak about or otherwise interfere in a game. Spectators are not allowed to interfere in a game. The arbiter may expel offenders from the playing venue. 12.8   Unless authorised by the arbiter, it is forbidden for anybody to use a mobile phone or any kind of communication device in the playing venue or any contiguous area designated by the arbiter.  12.9   Options available to the arbiter concerning penalties: 12.9.1    warning, 12.9.2    increasing the remaining time of the opponent, 12.9.3    reducing the remaining time of the offending player, 12.9.4    increasing the points scored in the game by the opponent to the maximum available for that game, 12.9.5    reducing the points scored in the game by the offending person, 12.9.6    declaring the game to be lost by the offending player (the arbiter shall also decide the opponent’s score), TheArbitermust takecareto avoidanykindof cheating bytheplayers.

Rapid Chess A.1    A ‘Rapid chess’ game is one where either all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player; or the time allotted plus 60 times any increment is of more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player.  A.2    Players do not need to record the moves, but do not lose their rights to claims normally based on a scoresheet. The player can, at any time, ask the arbiter to provide him/her with a scoresheet, in order to write the moves.  A.3    The penalties mentioned in Articles 7 and 9 of the Competitive Rules of Play shall be one minute instead of two minutes. A.4    The Competitive Rules of Play shall apply if: A.4.1    one arbiter supervises at most three games and A.4.2    each game is recorded by the arbiter or his/her assistant and, if possible, by electronic means. A.4.3    The player may at any time, when it is his/her move, ask the arbiter or his/her assistant to show him/her the scoresheet. This may be requested a maximum of five times in a game. More requests shall be considered as a distraction of the opponent. Example 1: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is30 minutes for the whole game and 30 seconds increment for each move.That is: for60moveswewouldget30\\'+(30\"x60)=30\\'+30\\'=60\\'.AsaccordingtoArticleA1\"A Rapid Chess\" is a gamewhere all moves must be completed in less than 60minutesforeach player,then suchagameisconsideredtobestandardchess. Example 2: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is10 minutes for the whole game and 5 seconds increment for each move.   That is: for60 moves we would get 10\\'+ (5” x 60) = 10\\' +5\\' = 15\\'. So according to Article A.1suchagame isconsideredtobeRapidChess. Whendoing thesecalculationsgamesusingdelaysaretreatedin thesameway. Players are allowed to record the moves, but they may stop recording any time theywish. Players may claim a draw without the support of a scoresheet when they are playingon electronic boards. The arbiter also has theright to accept or refuse a claimwithoutscoresheetevidence basedonhisobservations. IfaplayeraskstheArbitertoshowhimthescoresheet,theclockshouldnotbestopped. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  A.5    Otherwise the following apply: A.5.1    From the initial position, once 10 moves have been completed by each player, A.5.1.1    No change can be made to the clock setting, unless the schedule of the event would be adversely affected.   A.5.1.2    No claim can be made regarding incorrect set-up or orientation of the chessboard. In case of incorrect king placement, castling is not allowed. In case of incorrect rook placement, castling with this rook is not allowed. A.5.2    If the arbiter observes an action taken under Article 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3 or 7.5.4, he/she shall act according to Article 7.5.5, provided the opponent has not made his/her next move. If the arbiter does not intervene, the opponent is entitled to claim, provided the opponent has not made his/her next move. If the opponent does not claim and the arbiter does not intervene, the illegal move shall stand and the game shall continue. Once the opponent has made his/her next move, an illegal move cannot be corrected unless this is agreed by the players without intervention of the arbiter.  A.5.3    To claim a win on time, the claimant may pause the chessclock and notify the arbiter. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the claimant cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.  A.5.4    If the arbiter observes both kings are in check, or a pawn stands on the rank furthest from its starting position, he/she shall wait until the next move is completed. Then, if an illegal position is still on the board, he/she shall declare the game drawn. IftheCompetitionRulesareusedtheymustapplytoeveryround.Theycannotbeintroduced,for example,onlyfor thefinal. This means that the player does not lose the game with the first illegal move, but onlywith the second, as it is in standard chess. The penalty is also the same as in standardchess. If both clocks indicate 0.00, no claim for win on time can be submitted by the players,but the Arbiter shall decide the result of the game by the flag that is shown on one ofthe clocks.The playerwhose clockshowsthisindicationlosesthe game. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t   A.5.5    The arbiter shall also call a flag fall, if he/she observes it. A.6    The regulations of an event shall specify whether Article A.4 or Article A.5 shall apply for the entire event.   Appendix B. Blitz B.1    A ‘blitz’ game is one where all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of 10 minutes or less for each player; or the allotted time plus 60 times any increment is 10 minutes or less for each player. B.2    The Competitive Rules of Play shall apply if: B.2.1    one arbiter supervises one game and B.2.2    each game is recorded by the arbiter or his/her assistant and, if possible, by electronic means. B.2.3    The player may at any time, when it is his/her move, ask the arbiter or his/her assistant to show him/her the scoresheet. This may be requested a maximum of five times in a game. More requests shall be considered as a distraction of the opponent.   B.3    Otherwise, play shall be governed by the Rapid chess Laws as in Article A.2, A.3 and A.5.

Rating Calculation for an Unrated Player Abstracts of the FIDE Rating Regulations An unrated players’ first ambition is to get international rating, by playing in FIDE rated tournaments and they may also be interested in knowing the criteria and procedure to get a rating.  A brief account of the same is furnished below. For more details, a player has to refer http://www. https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/B022024  Applied from 1 March, 2024 Rate of Play 1.1     For a game to be rated each player must at the start of the game have the following minimum periods in which to complete all the moves, assuming the game lasts 60 moves. Where at least one of the players in the game has a rating of 2400 or higher, each player must have a minimum of 120 minutes. Where at least one of the players in the game has a rating 1800 or higher, each player must have a minimum of 90 minutes. Where both of the players in the game are rated below 1800, each player must have a minimum of 60 minutes. Unplayed Games              5.1     Whether these occur because of forfeiture or any other reason, they are not counted. Except in case of force majeure, any game where both players have made at least one move will be rated, unless the regulations relating to Fair Play require otherwise. Official FIDE Rating List 7.1     On the first day of each month, FIDE shall prepare a list which incorporates all rated play during the rating period into the previous list.  7.1.2      The following data will be published concerning each player whose rating is at least 1400 as of the current list: FIDE title, Federation, Current Rating, ID Number, Number of games rated in the rating period, Year of Birth, Gender and the current value of K for the player. 7.1.4      A rating for a player new to the list shall be published when it is based on at least 5 games against rated opponents. This need not be met in one tournament. Results from other tournaments played within consecutive \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t rating periods of not more than 26 months are pooled to obtain the initial rating. The rating must be at least 1400. 7.2     Players who are not to be included on the list or to be shown as inactive: 7.2.1      Players whose ratings drop below 1400 are shown as unrated on the next list. Thereafter they are treated in the same manner as any other unrated player. 7.2.2      Players listed as active: A player is considered to commence inactivity if they play no rated games in a one-year period.   A player regains their activity if they play at least one rated game in a period.  They are then listed as active on the next list. 8.

Its function is to produce measurement information of the best statistical quality  8.1     The rating scale is an arbitrary one with a class interval set at 200 points. The tables that follow show the conversion of fractional score \\'p\\' into rating difference \\'dp\\'. For a zero or 1.0 score dp is necessarily indeterminate but is shown notionally as 800. The second table shows conversion of difference in rating \\'D\\' into scoring probability \\'PD\\' for the higher \\'H\\' and the lower \\'L\\' rated player respectively. Thus, the two tables are effectively mirror-images. 8.1.1      The table of conversion from fractional score, p, into rating differences, dp 8.1.2      Table of conversion of difference in rating, D, into scoring probability PD, for the higher, H, and the lower, L, rated player respectively.

Otherwise, their rating is calculated using all their results as in 7.1.4. 8.2.2      Ra is the average rating of the player\\'s rated opponents plus two hypothetical opponents rated 1800.

The maximum initial rating is 2200. 8.2.4      If an unrated player receives a published rating before a particular tournament in which they have played is rated, then they are rated as a rated player with their current rating, but in the rating of their opponents they are counted as an unrated player.        8.3     Determining the rating change for a rated player 8.3.1      For each game played against a rated player, determine the difference in rating between the player and their opponent, D. A difference in rating of more than 400 points shall be counted for rating purposes as though it were a difference of 400 points.  8.3.2      a) Use table 8.1.2 to determine the player\\'s score probability PD for each game. b) Delta R = score - PD.  For each game, the score is 1, 0.5 or 0. c) Sigma Delta R = the sum of Delta Rs for a tournament or Rating Period. d) Sigma Delta R x K = the Rating Change for a tournament or Rating Period. 8.3.3      K is the development coefficient. K = 40 for a player new to the rating list until they have completed events with at least 30 games. K = 20 as long as a player\\'s rating remains under 2400. K = 10 once a player\\'s published rating has reached 2400 and remains at that level subsequently, even if the rating drops below 2400. K = 40 for all players until the end of the year of their 18th birthday, as long as their rating remains under 2300. If the number of games (n) for a player on any list for a rating period multiplied by K (as defined above) exceeds 700, then K shall be the largest whole number such that K x n does not exceed 700.  Rating Calculation of an Unrated Player Case 1 The details of an unrated player who played in three rated tournaments against the following players, with the results mentioned against them.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tEaxmple: Rd. Name Rtg Res. 1 Ramesh 1450  w 1  2 Suresh 1444  b 1  3 Haresh 1515  b 0  4 Girish 1565  w 0  5 Sri Hari 1652  b 0  6 Gagan 1403  b 0.5   Calculate the new rating to be published. The total rating of the six rated opponents: 1450 + 1444 + 1515 + 1565 + 1652 + 1403      = 9029 Rating of two imaginary opponents = 3600 Total rating of 8 rated opponents  = 9029 + 3600 = 12629 Rating average of 8 opponents  = 12629/8 Ra      = 1579 Points scored    = 2.5 Total points scored    = 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 Dp (3.5/8 = 0.44)    = 0.43 New rating Ru    = Ra + dp       = 1579 – 43       = 1536 Case 2 An unrated player has played against five rated opponents in two tournaments who have an average rating of 1500 and has scored three points. What will be his new rating? Average rating of five opponents = 1500 Total rating of five opponents       = 1500 * 5 = 7500 Rating of 2 imaginary opponents = 1800 * 2 = 3600 Total rating of 7 opponents           = 7500 + 3600 = 11000 Average rating of 7 opponents   11000/7 = 1571 Points scored against 7 opponents      = 3.0 +1.0 = 4.0 Dp for 4.0/7 (= 0.57)         = 50 New rating       = Ra + dp       = 1571 + 50    = 1621  A player might have scored many points against rated players from several rating tournaments, but his or her rating would not have been published by FIDE. The reason is that, after calculating their rating in the above said manner, the resulting rating must at least be 1000. If it is less than 1000, the rating will not be published.Naturally, the rating obtained will be higher, if a player meets stronger opponents.   Tiebreaks  The recommended tiebreaks for the Indian tournaments are in the following order Buchholz Cut 1 Buchholz \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  Sonneborn Berger Direct Encounter Number of wins (forfeit included) Number of wins with black.  Buchholz System  The Buchholz System is the sum of the scores of each of the opponents of a player.  (b1) The Median Buchholz is the Buchholz reduced by the highest and the lowest scores of the opponents.  (b3) The Buchholz Cut 1 is the Buchholz score reduced by the lowest score of the opponents.  (b4) The Buchholz Cut 2 is the Buchholz score reduced by the two lowest scores of the opponents.   Sonneborn-Berger System  Sonneborn-Berger for Individual Tournaments is the sum of the scores of the opponents a player has defeated and half the scores of the players with whom he has drawn.   Unplayed Rounds Management in Swiss Tournaments In Individual or Team Swiss tournaments, the tie-breaks Buchholz (see Article 8.1), Sonneborn-Berger, which are directly or indirectly based on opponents\\' results, are affected by the presence of unplayed rounds in the record of participants. 16.1   The important definitions are used in this section: 16.1.2    available-to-play round: any round in which a participant played their game, or ended up without a game due to a pairing-allocated bye, the opponent did not arrive to play, or unforeseen circumstances that resulted in the award of a full-point-bye 16.2   Unplayed rounds can be divided into the following categories: 16.2.1    Pairing-allocated byes or full-point byes 16.2.2    Forfeit wins 16.2.4    Forfeit losses 16.3   When a participant has unplayed rounds, for the sole purpose of calculating the tie-break of their opponents, the participant\\'s score is adjusted in the following way: 16.3.1    Unplayed rounds of categories 16.2.1, 16.2.2, 16.2.3 and 16.2.4 are evaluated with the result (win, draw, loss) corresponding to the awarded number of points or, for teams, match points and game points. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t 16.4   To calculate the participant\\'s own tie-break, any of their unplayed rounds are evaluated as if there was a game played against a dummy that concluded the tournament with the same number of points as the participant himself, and ended with the result (win, draw, loss) corresponding to the awarded number of points. 16.5   Cut-1 Exception A voluntary unplayed round (\"VUR\") is aa forfeit loss (16.2.3 to 16.2.5). 16.5.1     When a modifier calls for cutting the least significant value (see Articles 14.1 to 14.4) of a participant with one or more VURs, the lowest contribution coming from such rounds shall be cut, as long as such contribution is not lower than the least significant value. This means: \\uf0b7 For Buchholz, cut the lowest contribution coming from a VUR. \\uf0b7 For Sonneborn-Berger, after determining: a. the lowest contribution coming from a VUR b. the least significant value (see 14.1.1.d and 14.1.2) cut the higher of these two values (note: they are the same element if the least significant value comes from a VUR). The data of a player in a tournament is given below: Rd.

Arpan Das had a forfeit in round 3, as his opponent did not come for the game. At the end of the tournament, Arpan Das had scored four points. Hence, the opponent of Arpan Das in the third round is assumed to have scored four points at the end of the tournament. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  Rd.   Name FED Pts Res. 1 GM Laxman R.R.

This player receives a pairing-allocated bye: no opponent, no colour and as many points as are rewarded for a win, unless the rules of the tournament state otherwise. d A player who has already received a pairing-allocated bye, or has already scored a (forfeit) win due to an opponent not appearing in time, shall not receive the pairing-allocated bye. e In general, players are paired to others with the same score. f For each player the difference between the number of black and the number of white games shall not be greater than 2 or less than –2.  Each system may have exceptions to this rule in the last round of a tournament. g No player shall receive the same colour three times in a row. Each system may have exceptions to this rule in the last round of a tournament. h 1 In general, a player is given the colour with which he played less games.  2 If colours are already balanced, then, in general, the player is given the colour that alternates from the last one with which he played. i The pairing rules must be such transparent that the person who is in charge for the pairing can explain them. It is not allowed to alter the correct pairings in favour of any player.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  B. Initial Order   1 Before the start of the tournament, a measure of the player’s strength is assigned to each player. The strength is usually represented by rating lists of the players. If one rating list is available for all participating players, then this rating list should be used.  It is advisable to check all ratings supplied by players.   2 Before the first round the players are ranked in order of, respectively a. Strength (rating) b. FIDE-title (GM-IM- WGM-FM-WIM-CM-WFM-WCM-no title) c. alphabetically (unless it has been previously stated that this criterion has been replaced by another one)   D. Pairing, colour and publishing rules   2 A player who is absent without notifying the arbiter will be considered as withdrawn, unless the absence is explained with acceptable arguments before the next pairing is published.   3 Players who withdraw from the tournament will no longer be paired.   4 Players known in advance not to play in a particular round are not paired in that round and score zero (unless the rules of the tournament say otherwise).   5 Only played games count in situations where the colour sequence is meaningful. So, for instance, a player with a colour history of BWB=W (i.e. no valid game in round-4) will be treated as if his colour history was =BWBW. WB=WB will count as =WBWB, BWW=B=W as ==BWWBW and so on. Two paired players, who did not play their game, may be paired together in a future round.   8 If a result was written down incorrectly: If the error notification is made after the pairing but before the end of the next round, it will affect the next pairing to be done. If the error notification is made after the end of the next round, the correction will be made after the tournament for submission to rating evaluation only.      10 Once published, the pairings shall not be changed unless they are found to violate C.04.1.b (Two players shall not play against each other more than once).  C.04.3 FIDE (Dutch) System   A.3 Scoregroups and pairing brackets     A scoregroup is normally composed of (all) the players with the same score.  A (pairing) bracket is a group of players to be paired. It is composed of players coming from one same scoregroup (called resident players) and of players who remained unpaired after the pairing of the previous bracket. A (pairing) bracket is homogeneous if all the players have the same score; otherwise it is heterogeneous.   A.4 Floaters and floats     a Adownfloater is a player who remains unpaired in a bracket, and is thus moved to the next bracket. In the destination bracket, such players are called \"moved-down players\" (MDPs for short). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    b After two players with different scores have played each other in a round, the higher ranked player receives a downfloat, the lower one an upfloat. A player who, for whatever reason, does not play in a round, also receives a downfloat.   A.5 Byes     See C.04.1.c (Should the number of players to be paired be odd, one player is unpaired. This player receives a pairing-allocated bye: no opponent, no colour and as many points as are rewarded for a win, unless the regulations of the tournament state otherwise).   A.6 Colour differences and colour preferences     The colour difference of a player is the number of games played with white minus the number of games played with black by this player.  The colour preference is the colour that a player should ideally receive for the next game. It can be determined for each player who has played at least one game.     a An absolute colour preference occurs when a player’s colour difference is greater than +1 or less than -1, or when a player had the same colour in the two latest rounds he played. The preference is white when the colour difference is less than -1 or when the last two games were played with black. The preference is black when the colour difference is greater than +1, or when the last two games were played with white.     b A strong colour preference occurs when a player‘s colour difference is +1 (preference for black) or -1 (preference for white).     c A mild colour preference occurs when a player’s colour difference is zero, the preference being to alternate the colour with respect to the previous game he played.     d Players who did not play any games have no colour preference (the preference of their opponents is granted). Relative Criteria  (These are in descending priority. They should be fulfilled as much as possible. To comply with these criteria, transpositions or even exchanges may be applied, but no player should be moved down to a lower score bracket). B.3 The difference of the scores of two players paired against each other should be as small as possible and ideally zero  B.4 As many players as possible receive their colour preference B.5 No player shall receive an identical float in two consecutive rounds. B.6 No player shall have an identical float as two rounds before.   A.7 Topscorers     Topscorers are players who have a score of over 50% of the maximum possible score when pairing the final round of the tournament.  C Pairing Criteria   Absolute Criteria   No pairing shall violate the following absolute criteria:   C.1see C.04.1.b (Two players shall not play against each other more than once)   C.2see C.04.1.d (A player who has already received a pairing-allocated bye, or has already scored a (forfeit) win due to an opponent not appearing in time, shall not receive the pairing-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t  allocated bye).   C.3non-topscorers (see A.7) with the same absolute colour preference (see A6.a) shall not meet (see C.04.1.f and C.04.1.g). D.1 Transpositions in S2    A transposition is a change in the order in S2. D.2 Exchanges in homogeneous brackets or remainders (original S1 ↔ original S2)    An exchange in a homogeneous brackets (also called a resident-exchange) is a swap of two equally sized groups between the original S1 and the original S2. E Colour Allocation rules   Initial-colour: It is the colour determined by drawing of lots before the pairing of the first round.   For each pair apply (with descending priority):   E.1 Grant both colour preferences.   E.2 Grant the stronger colour preference. If both are absolute, grant the wider colour difference  E.3 Taking into account C.04.2.D.5, alternate the colours to the most recent time in which one player had white and the other black.   E.4 Grant the colour preference of the higher ranked player. Pair the highest player of S1 against the highest one of S2, the second highest one of S1 against the second highest one of S2, etc. If now P pairings are obtained in compliance with the current requirements the pairing of this score bracket is considered complete. o in case of a homogeneous or remainder score bracket: remaining players are moved down to the next score bracket. With this score bracket restart at C1.
